I am a postdoc at the University of Georgia, working with Paul Pollack. I received my Ph.D. from Dartmouth College in 2023, advised by [Carl Pomerance](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~carlp/). My research is in analytic number theory. Previously, I was a postdoc at Max Planck Institute for Mathematics. 

My Ph.D thesis can be found [here](https://stvfan.github.io/files/papers/PhDthesis.pdf) or at [Dartmouth Digital Commons](https://digitalcommons.dartmouth.edu/dissertations/156/).
