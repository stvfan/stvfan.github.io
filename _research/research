My research centers on how prime numbers distribute among natural numbers and interesting applications of such information 
to various problems in analytic and probabilistic number theory. I am particularly interested in the distribution of primes 
in intervals and arithmetic progressions as well as in gaps between consecutive primes. Well-known unsolved problems in these 
directions include the Riemann Hypothesis and the Twin Prime Conjecture. To study primes, I use a combination of tools from 
complex analysis, harmonic analysis, sieve theory, probability theory and combinatorics, and this is where my area of research 
interacts with other areas in exciting ways.

Studying the distribution of primes is important in that primes are the building blocks of natural numbers and information 
about them is therefore indispensable in the study of plenty of arithmetic objects and structures. One such example is arithmetic 
functions, which are functions defined on natural numbers. In my research, I study the mean values of these functions as 
well as their distributions when modeled as appropriate random variables. As in my study of primes, I apply a variety of techniques 
to handle problems about arithmetic functions. Not only does my research find its applications in my field, but it also sheds light 
on some objects from algebraic number theory. For instance, my research on weighted Erd&#337;s–Kac theorems leads to a new proof of a 
central limit theorem on Ramanujan’s τ-function due to Elliott, and my recent work with Paul Pollack on an analogue of Carmichael’s function establishes 
a rather accurate estimate for the typical size of an order in a fixed quadratic number field.
