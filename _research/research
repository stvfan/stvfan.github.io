My research centers on how prime numbers distribute among natural numbers and interesting applications of such information 
to various problems in analytic and probabilistic number theory. I am particularly interested in the distribution of primes 
in long and short intervals as well as in arithmetic progressions and in small and large gaps between consecutive primes. 
Well-known unsolved prob- lems in these directions include the Riemann Hypothesis and the Twin Prime Conjecture. To study 
primes, I use a combination of tools from complex analysis, harmonic analysis, sieve theory, probability theory and 
combinatorics, and this is where my field of research interacts with several other fields in exciting ways.
