My research centers on how prime numbers distribute among natural numbers and interesting applications of such information 
to various problems in analytic and probabilistic number theory. I am particularly interested in the distribution of primes 
in long and short intervals as well as in arithmetic progressions and in small and large gaps between consecutive primes. 
Well-known unsolved problems in these directions include the Riemann Hypothesis and the Twin Prime Conjecture. To study 
primes, I use a combination of tools from complex analysis, harmonic analysis, sieve theory, probability theory and 
combinatorics, and this is where my field of research interacts with several other fields in exciting ways.

Studying the distribution of primes is important in that primes are the building blocks of natural numbers and information 
about them is therefore indispensable in the study of plenty of arithmetic objects and structures. One such example is arithmetic 
functions, which are functions defined on natural numbers. In my research, I study the mean values of these functions as 
well as their distributions when modeled as appropriate random variables. As in my study of primes, I apply a variety of techniques 
to handle problems about arithmetic functions. Not only does my research find its applications in my field, but it also sheds light 
on some objects from algebraic number theory. For instance, my research on weighted Erd&#337;s–Kac theorems leads to a new proof of a central 
limit theorem on Ramanujan’s τ-function due to Elliott, and my ongoing work on an analogue of Carmichael’s function provides a rather 
accurate estimate for the typical size of the quadratic elasticity of a general quadratic imaginary number field.
